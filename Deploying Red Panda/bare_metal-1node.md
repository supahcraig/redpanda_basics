# RPM install on EC2 for a single node

The purpose of this document is to spin up a minimally configured 1 node redpanda "cluster" & configure basic connectivity from a remote machine.


https://docs.redpanda.com/current/deploy/deployment-option/self-hosted/manual/production/dev-deployment/


## Prerequisites

* Single EC2 instance, `c6a.large` with 30GB is suitable.  Smaller _may_ work.
  * Ubuntu 24.04 (although older versions will definitely work)
  * EC2 Needs to be accessible from the client machine on ports `9092` & `9644`
  * EC2 needs ssh access to run the install

* A machine to act as the Redpanda client.  This can be your local machine, or another EC2 instance.  This will need rpk installed.
  * [https://docs.redpanda.com/current/get-started/rpk-install/#install-rpk-on-linux](https://docs.redpanda.com/current/get-started/rpk-install/)


---

## 1.  Run the installer

SSH into your EC2 instance and run the following to install Redpanda

```
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.redpanda.com/nzc4ZYQK3WRGd9sy/redpanda/cfg/setup/bash.deb.sh' | \
sudo -E bash && sudo apt install redpanda -y
```


## 2.  Bootstrap the Cluster

Where the `--ips` flag is set to the private IP of your broker.

```
sudo rpk redpanda config bootstrap --self $(hostname -I) --ips $(hostname -I) # only works for a one node deployment
sudo rpk redpanda config set redpanda.empty_seed_starts_cluster false
```

### Resulting /etc/redpanda/redpanda.yaml

This is the config that will be generated by the boostrap command.

```
redpanda:
    data_directory: /var/lib/redpanda/data
    empty_seed_starts_cluster: false
    seed_servers:
        - host:
            address: <Your Private IP>
            port: 33145
    rpc_server:
        address: <Your Private IP>
        port: 33145
    kafka_api:
        - address: <Your Private IP>
          port: 9092
    admin:
        - address: <Your Private IP>
          port: 9644
    advertised_rpc_api:
        address: <Your Private IP>
        port: 33145
    advertised_kafka_api:
        - address: <Your Private IP>
          port: 9092
    developer_mode: true
rpk:
    coredump_dir: /var/lib/redpanda/coredump
pandaproxy: {}
schema_registry: {}
```

Note that you will _likely_ want to change the rpc_server, kafka_api, and admin listener addresses to `0.0.0.0` to allow external traffic.   The bootstrap process sets the listener & advertised addresses to the IP specified in `--self`.   Advertised addresses may not be `0.0.0.0` (Redpanda will not start) which is why some manual intervention is typically required here.


## 3.  Start Redpanda


```
sudo systemctl start redpanda-tuner redpanda
```

### Verify Cluster

`rpk cluster health` should return something like

```
CLUSTER HEALTH OVERVIEW
=======================
Healthy:                          true
Unhealthy reasons:                []
Controller ID:                    0
All nodes:                        [0]
Nodes down:                       []
Leaderless partitions (0):        []
Under-replicated partitions (0):  []
```

and `rpk cluster info` should return the ip of your single node.

```
CLUSTER
=======
redpanda.8ab99fa3-1ab2-4db6-bf54-eb42f96ee319

BROKERS
=======
ID    HOST          PORT
0*    10.100.7.153  9092
```

### Verify the IP & port traffic

Adding `-v` to `rpk` commands will reveal information about the IPs & ports in use.   On-broker traffic will typically look like this:

```
18:45:41.777  DEBUG  opening connection to broker  {"addr": "127.0.0.1:9092", "broker": "seed_0"}
18:45:41.777  DEBUG  connection opened to broker  {"addr": "127.0.0.1:9092", "broker": "seed_0"}
18:45:41.777  DEBUG  issuing api versions request  {"broker": "seed_0", "version": 3}
18:45:41.777  DEBUG  wrote ApiVersions v3  {"broker": "seed_0", "bytes_written": 31, "write_wait": "35.511µs", "time_to_write": "27.36µs", "err": null}
18:45:41.778  DEBUG  read ApiVersions v3  {"broker": "seed_0", "bytes_read": 296, "read_wait": "57.632µs", "time_to_read": "136.083µs", "err": null}
18:45:41.778  DEBUG  connection initialized successfully  {"addr": "127.0.0.1:9092", "broker": "seed_0"}
18:45:41.778  DEBUG  wrote Metadata v7  {"broker": "seed_0", "bytes_written": 22, "write_wait": "814.859µs", "time_to_write": "20.76µs", "err": null}
18:45:41.778  DEBUG  read Metadata v7  {"broker": "seed_0", "bytes_read": 95, "read_wait": "40.751µs", "time_to_read": "45.301µs", "err": null}
```

Note that the address is `127.0.0.1` on port 9092 for kafka api requests, and port 9644 for admin api requests.



## 4.  Connections from a remote machine

This is the barebones way to make it work.  More sophisticated listener setups with different advertised addresses/ports is possible.

On your local machine, the rpk profile needs to look like this, and the EC2 instance must be open to traffic from the source on 9092 & 9644 (for kafka & admin apis).  You can create & modify an rpk profile as follows:

### rpk profile

`rpk profile create ec2_rpm`

`rpk profile edit`

```
name: ec2_rpm
prompt: hi-red, "[%n]"
description: EC2 RPM 1-node
kafka_api:
    brokers:
        - <Your Redpanda Broker Public IP>:9092
admin_api:
    addresses:
        - <Your Redpanda Broker Public IP>:9644
```

Where the IP addresses given above is the public IP of your broker. 

Then view your current profile using `rpk profile print`


### Verify Connectivity

Similar to testing from on-broker, you can test the same rpk commands from your local machine (aka off-broker).  Again, using the `-v` flag will reveal information about how rpk & the cluster is handling your request.


`rpk cluster info -v`

```
13:50:52.759  DEBUG  opening connection to broker  {"addr": "3.17.174.176:9092", "broker": "seed_0"}
13:50:52.882  DEBUG  connection opened to broker  {"addr": "3.17.174.176:9092", "broker": "seed_0"}
13:50:52.882  DEBUG  issuing api versions request  {"broker": "seed_0", "version": 3}
13:50:52.883  DEBUG  wrote ApiVersions v3  {"broker": "seed_0", "bytes_written": 31, "write_wait": "267µs", "time_to_write": "39.792µs", "err": null}
13:50:52.920  DEBUG  read ApiVersions v3  {"broker": "seed_0", "bytes_read": 296, "read_wait": "248.042µs", "time_to_read": "37.217416ms", "err": null}
13:50:52.921  DEBUG  connection initialized successfully  {"addr": "3.17.174.176:9092", "broker": "seed_0"}
13:50:52.921  DEBUG  wrote Metadata v7  {"broker": "seed_0", "bytes_written": 22, "write_wait": "162.834291ms", "time_to_write": "235.917µs", "err": null}
13:50:52.957  DEBUG  read Metadata v7  {"broker": "seed_0", "bytes_read": 95, "read_wait": "486.208µs", "time_to_read": "35.494334ms", "err": null}
CLUSTER
=======
redpanda.8ab99fa3-1ab2-4db6-bf54-eb42f96ee319

BROKERS
=======
ID    HOST          PORT
0*    10.100.7.153  9092
```

Note that the traffic is routed to the public IP of the broker (`3.17.174.176` in this case) on port 9092.  Recall that the public IP was set in your local rpk profile (not to be confused with the `redpanda.yaml` on the broker).
